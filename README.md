# IncrementAndDecrementCounter-Swift

This app is designed to allow you to keep track of a count by incrementing or decrementing it with the touch of a button.

To use this app, follow these steps:

1. Download the Xcode IDE and open the project file in Xcode.

2. Build and run the project on a simulator or a connected iOS device.

3. Once the app is running, you will see a simple interface with a label that displays the current count and two buttons labeled "+" and "-".

4. To increment the count, tap the "+" button. To decrement the count, tap the "-" button.

5. The count will update in real time, and the label will reflect the new value.

6. To reset the count to zero, simply tap and hold the label. A confirmation prompt will appear, and if you confirm, the count will be reset to zero.

That's it! This app is simple to use and can be helpful for keeping track of anything that requires a count. Feel free to modify and customize it to suit your needs.
